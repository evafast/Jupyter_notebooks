# Jupyter_notebooks

This is a collection of Jupyter notebooks for various analysis in the lab or for helping me understand general concepts. Some of them I have also described on my [blog](https://evafast.github.io/). Here's a better description below.

190801_intuitiveORA.ipynb
- an notebook on overrepresentation analysis (ORA) in the context of biological pathway enrichment. The size of different input quantities (Gene sets, number of Genes enriched, overlap) can be changed and the effect on the p-value (one-tailed Fisher-exact test) can be easily evaluated.

Regressing_out_female_cells.ipynb
- a notebook book on single cell analysis with a mixture of male and female cells. By using the gene Xist potential effects of female cells can be accounted for (regressed out).
